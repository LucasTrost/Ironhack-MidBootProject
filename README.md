## Project Brief

**Scenario:**
As a market analyst for real estate agency: TheAgency, my job is to work with and utilize data to give us an edge over our competitors. Thus it was only logical, that before we open an office in Seattle, I would do exactly that...

**Challenge:**
Using a dataset I pulled from a market study in 2015, I was to build a model that can predict the price of houses in the Seattle area. In addition, as TheAgency regards itself as a high-end real estate agency, I was tasked to explore what features exactly determine high prices.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To explore and understand the data I chose to use the following tools:
### Tableau:
Tableau is a great tool to jump into dataset, play around, and gain insights. I spent a significant chunk of time on Tableau, creating Dashboards and stories, through which I became very familiar with the data.
For Tableau workbook see [here](https://github.com/LucasTrost/Ironhack-MidBootProject/tree/main/Tableau)
### SQL:
Importing the data to SQL was no smooth sailing. Apparently the csv. file from the study was corrupted. In order to circumvent said problem, I exported the excel version of the data into Python, where I turned it into a DataFrame, and downloaded as a csv. This seemed to work, and I was able to get started on querying. Overall I was already pretty happy with my understanding of the data, which is why I kept querying to a minimal.
