## Project Brief

**Scenario:**
As a market analyst for real estate agency: TheAgency, my job is to work with and utilize data to give us an edge over our competitors. Thus it was only logical, that before we open an office in Seattle I would do exactly that...

**Challenge:**
Using a dataset I pulled from a market study in 2015, I was to build a model that can predict the price of houses in the Seattle area. In addition, as TheAgency regards itself as a high-end real estate agency, I was tasked to explore what determines high prices in Seattle (Price >=650k).
